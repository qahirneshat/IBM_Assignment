# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized. I am also trying to add some more texts here so that it looks original, not just copy-paste. You fellow students can understand what I am talking about.

# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science
# - Famous used libraries
# - Ordered List
# - Unordered list
# - Arithmathic Operations

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. Scala
# 4. SQL
# 5. Julia

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. Scikit-learn
# 2. Pandas
# 3. Pandas
# 4. Scipy
# 5. Matplotlib
# 6. Seaborn
# 7. GGPLOT

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 
# - For Addition use this symbol +
# - For Subtraction use this symbol -
# - For Division use this symbol /
# - For Multiplicaiton use this symbol *

# In[2]:


#  This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

minutes = 200
seconds = 60
hour = minutes / seconds

print(hour)
